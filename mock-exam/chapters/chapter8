1. A x A, D : Overlooked, higher level streams can take in lower streams.
2. F x B, E, F : Vague question.
3. C, D
4. C
5. B, D, E
6. A x A, E : ObjectInputStream.readObject() can throw ClassNotFoundExcetion even when result is not explicitly cast.
7. D
8. A, E x A : The path pointed by a file or the path of it's parent need not exist.
9. A, D x A : Overlook, an instance variable can be either be serializable or transient.
10. A, B, C x C, F : Overlooked, code does not delet eany directory.
11. C, E, G : To copy a file it should be read first then written to a new file.
12. B x B, C : Java will convert backslash or forward slash to the correct separator based on the file system. Root directory for linux is /, for windows it's drive:\\ (e.g. C:\\) or double backslash (\\\\).
13. A, C, E
14. E
15. A
16. D x D, F : Overlooked, static variables makes it harder to serialize an object if you want to keep track of the static values.
17. A, B, D, G
18. B, D, E : There are only printf and format method in Console for writing. Use the returned writer to have additional methods (e.g. print, println).
19. B, C, D : This is permitted, new ObjectOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("obj.data")))
20. A, C
21. A, C : It's serialVersionUID and not serialUID or any other variant.
22. E
23. E x H : Before calling mark() be sure to call markSuported() otherwise an runtime exception will be thrown.
