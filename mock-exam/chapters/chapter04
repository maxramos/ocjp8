1. D
2. F
3. F x E : Overlooked, You can only process a stream once.
4. A,B
5. A,B
6. F x A : Overlooked, allMatch is short circuited by 1 false condition, anyMatch by 1 true condition, and noneMatch by 1 true condition (tricky).
7. F
8. D,E
9. B,D
10. F
11. B,D x B,C,E : Note of the use of x++ and ++x in Stream.iterate(), x++ doesn't increment the result since 1 is always returned.
12. A,F,G
13. F
14. D
15. D,E
16. D x C : PartitioningBy always return a map with 2 keys (false, true) even if stream is empty, GroupingBy will only return keys that are needed so an empty stream will return empty map.
17. E
18. D
19. A,C,E
