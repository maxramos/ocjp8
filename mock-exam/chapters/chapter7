8. A x G : Using findAny() on a sorted stream (both sequential and parallel) doesn't guarantee it will return the first record.
9. A, C, E
10. A x C : In a reduce(int, (a1, a2) -> a1.length() + a2, (c1, c2) -> c1 + c2), a2 is an int because the identity is an int.
11. A, F
12. E
13. A x A, G : Overlook, flatMap() returns a sequential stream. for a collect to run in parallel it must satisfy the 3 conditions. 
14. A x D : All methods of concurrent queue and deque with TimeUnit throws a check exception InterruptedException thus must be handled or declared. 
15. C, E, G
16. F x F, H : Overlooked, remember that ExecutorService must be shutdown or else the program will never terminate.
17. C x B : Overlooked, remember that in single thread executor task are never executed concurrently thus result is predictable.
18. F
19. A, F
20. A, D
21. A x A, C, D, E : Question is very vague, it means all possible scenarios so can have both null and non null result, can also have exceptions or can hand indefinitely.
