1. B
2. D
3. C x E : Remember if it's raw type then the type in for-each loop should be Object.
4. E
5. B,C,F
6. C
7. D x A,D : Overlooked, select two.
8. C
9. E
10. D x A : Overlooked, be careful with the position of variables in compare() method of Comparator.
11. A
12. A,B,D
13. A,B,E x B,E : Overlooked, ArrayDeque doesn't implement List, the one implementing List and Queue (i.e. Deque) is LinkedList.
14. C
15. D
16. B,D,F
17. B,D
18. A,B
19. A,C x A,D : There is no remove(index) in Queue so it will be autobox to remove(Integer) and since the value (i.e. 1) is not existing then nothing happened.
20. A x E : Overlooked, there's no contains() method in Map, it's containsKey() or containsValue().
21. A,F
22. B
23. B,E
24. A,D,F x F : Collection's forEach() method accepts Consumer functional interface thus requires 1 parameter.
25. F
