24. When visiting files recursively using FileVisitor the Path passed to the visitFile() method is a path containing its parent directory (possible absolute or relative).
    Given that, the PathMatcher must have a a glob of **.java instead of *.java or else it won't match anything.
    Use Path.getFileName() to get the file name only, then it is now possible to just use *.java
29. Remember that Optional needs a generic to match the declaration of the lambda expression.
    Otherwise use Object as the type in the lambda expression if it's possible.
60. Remember, DateFormat and NumberFormat parse() method throws ParseException.
