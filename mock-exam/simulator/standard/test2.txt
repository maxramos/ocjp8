- When declaring a consumer you can put method calls that return something on the lambda expression even though consumer have void as return.
  Instantiation of any class is also permitted inside it.
  What cannot be declared there is primitive literals and string literal.
- Name of the method in the functional interface doesn't matter as long as it's a single method it will still be valid.
- All exceptions in java.nio.file package has IOException as its superclass.
- If view-name is not specified in view-name:attribute-name when setting a file attribute then it defaults to basic.
- For IO classes used in try-with-resource clause it must catch or declare an IOException because of the implicit call to the close() method.
- Day Light Saving computation is executed first prior to computing the difference between 2 time or datetime.
- Day Light Saving is concerned with time zone. Not all regions have Day Light Saving.
- ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextXXX(); boolean, int, long, float, double
  ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextXXX(exclusive); int, long, double
  ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextXXX(inclusive, exclusive); int, long, double
- CyclicBarrier has 2 constructors:
  CyclicBarrier(int)
  CyclicBarrier(int, Runnable); where Runnable is executed after breaking the barrier.

18. All modification operation of CopyOnWriteArrayList is atomic including addAll().
    Only modification operation are blocked by another modification operation, readers are not blocked.
22. Remember BasicFileAttributeView, DosFileAttributeView, PosixFileAttributeView.
24. Threshold is recommended when using subdividing a big task like in fork/join framework to control sub task creation.
    Bigger threshold means lesser sub tasks.
30. Order of locale preference:
    a. Specific Locale
      i. messages_en_US.properties
      ii. messages_en.properties
    b. System Default Locale
      i. Locale.setDefault(Locale.FRANCE)
         messages_fr_FR.properties
    c. No Locale
      i. messages.properties
35. Although parallel stream process items simultaneously the order of the output when doing a reduce will still be the same as the input collection.
36. Stream methods: anyMatch(), allMatch(), and noneMatch all takes a Predicate as a param. And they all return a boolean.
40. Note that those that return Optional and its primitive variants will throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException when their get()/getAsXXX() methods are called and the the Optional is empty.
    Use Optional.orElse() method to prevent the throwing of the exception.
45. Stream method min() and max() requires Comparator as its param and they return Optional.
    Stream method reduce() with no identity returns an Optional.
49. DecimalFormat doesn't have a constructor that accepts Locale but it do have public constructors that accepts pattern.
    Since DecimalFormat extends NumberFormat it has the getXXXInstance() methods.
    NumberFormat doesn't have public constructor.
    For every getInstance() and getXXXInstance() methods of Number format there is a corresponding method that accepts a Locale param.
      getInstance()
      getNumberInstance()
      getIntegerInstance()
      getCurrencyInstance()
      getPercentInstance()
    NumberFormat, DateFormat, MessageFormat extends Format class.
    DecimalFormat, ChoiceFormat extends NumberFormat class.
    SimpleDateFormat extends DateFormat class.
