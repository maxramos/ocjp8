- Only compile time constants (i.e. final variables are allowed in the switch case).
- If both Optional.ofNullable() and Optioanl.orElseGet(Supplier) are null then Optional.orElseGet() will throw a NullPointerException.
- A super interface' default method can be redeclared as an abstract in the child interface.
  A super interface' abstract method can be implemented using a default method of the child interface. 
- Remember that only . and .. are valid in Paths.get() and not * or **.
- .. can never cancel out the root directory.
  It can however cancel out other parent directory.
- when using Path.subpath() the result does not start or end with \
- Intant.truncatedTo() truncates the smaller parts to 0.
  In an instant the truncatedTo() will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the ChronoUnit is bigger that DAYS.
- Only LocalDate doesn't support the method truncatedTo().

2. Overlooked, remember that only final or implicitly final local variables are allowed in inner class or a lambda expression.
7. Overlooked, Note that binary only contains 0 or 1.
   Floating point symbol are not allowed in binary.
   In 0x10000f, f is interpreted as a hex character and not a float symbol.
   f or F is only allowed in decimal or hexadecimal literals.
9. When the declared locale is not passed to the getInstance() methods of the Format related class then the default locale is used.
   Even if it's not passed in the getInstance() methods the default locale of the OS will be used.
   Internationalization is not automatic, the code and pages must be updated to support localization.
24. When computing the difference between 2 zoned date time always compute it in a straight way then apply later the sign to make it simple.
    The sign depends which of the 2 is bigger. Daylight Time saving can affect the result.
    Example:
      To compute the difference between 2am and 1am, switch the operator then compute how many hours will it take to go from 1am to 2am.
      Depending on the daylight saving add or subtract 1 hour first before computing the difference.
      When daylight saving is in place then the result is -2 hours difference.
    Remember that the moment that it reach 2am it will go back to 1am but that's one time only so you can still go to 2am in the next hour.
    This is only true at the end of the daylight time saving (e.g Nov) and not at the start (e.g Mar)
34. Take note of Collectors.mapping(mappingFunction, downStreamCollector) and Collectors.summarizingInt(mappingFunction)
35. Very tricky, the only allowable reference that List<? super String> can be stored is in the raw type List.
    List result = some_method_that_returns List<? super String>
36. Overlooked, remember that Callable allows the throwing of an exception.
40. Overlooked, Supplier has only the method get().
46. Overlooked, remember that in reduce the identity is only applied once.
50. Overlooked, remember that if the result of the stream operation is not assigned.
    It will not affect the original collection.
