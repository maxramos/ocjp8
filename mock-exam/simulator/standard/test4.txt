- Note that relativize doesn't normalize paths so don't implicitly remove .. and . when computing the result.
- Remember that though the Locale contains both language and country with fetching a ResourceBundle it is not necessary to have let's say messages_en_US.properties,
  Having messages_en.properties or messages.properties will satisfy the getBundle() call.
- Collectors.joining has 3 variants:
  joining()
  joining(delimiter)
  joining(delimiter,prefix,suffix); where prefix and suffix are applied to the result (concatenated string)
- You can format a LocalDateTime using DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE.
  As long a part exist to satisfy the required part of the formatter.
- Use FileVisitResult.SKIP_SUBTREE in preVisitDirectory()
  Use FileVisitResult.SKIP_SIBLINGS in visitFileFailed()
- Remember that in glob ? means exactly 1 character while in regex it's zero or one (optional)
- Remember that when printing Map of keys that is integers even if it's HashMap it is ordered by the integer's hashcode which is its value itself.
- anyMatch returns boolean and not Optional.

1. Overlooked, a parallel stream can process all elements even if there's a filter specially when running on multiple cores.
2. Overlooked, didn't notice the last choice; the only required change to work with generics is to add generic type to the declaration.
4. When an exception is thrown in the finally block then previous exception in the catch or try clause will be lost.
   When an exception thrown in the catch block (and not in the finally) then previous exception in the try clause will be lost (including suppressed exception if it contains one).
   There will only be suppressed exception if both the try clause and the implicit close of the try-with-resource throws an exception.
10. Note that Format.parse() method (including Format subclasses) throws a checked exception of ParseException; take care not to overlook this.
12. Remember that Collectors.mapping(Function, Collector) has only one variant and it accepts 2 params; It must have the downstream like Collectors.toList().
15. Note that a ResourceBundle has 2 subclass:
    PropertyResourceBundle
    ListResourceBundle
    ResourceBundle has the following method:
    String getString(String)
    String[] getStringArray(String); only works with ListResourceBundle
    Object getObject(String)
20. When printing a Duration, any overflow in second and minute part will be carried over to the next bigger part.
    61sec becomes PT1M1S
    61min becomes PT1H1M
    The hour part is allowed to overflow thus
    25hr becomes PT25H
    When printing Period, they are all taken as ease and printed in full, there's no overflow. 
39. Stream and its primitive variants don't have an of() method that accepts Collection type.
    At most you can pass an array.
40. Note that in Path.getName(index) it throws an IllegalArgumentException if the index is out of bounds
    Unlike in Collection classes like List.get(index) where it throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
48. AutoCloseable variable declared in the try-with-resource are implicitly final.
51. anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch() all returns boolean and NOT optional.
52. Though DosFileAttributes follow Java bean convention to access its attributes the PosixFileAttributes don't
    PosixFileAttributes has the following accessor methods:
    group(); GroupPrincipal, extends UserPrincipal
    owner(); UserPrincipal, extends Principal
    permissions(); PosixFilePermission, is an enum
59. Overlooked, keys produced by partitioningBy() is boolean and not String so be careful of "true" or "false" instead of true or false.
    When there's multiple call of Stream.parallel() and Stream.sequentual() in a single pipeline then the latest call wins.
